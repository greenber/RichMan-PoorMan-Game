/**
 * Now some planning, so this doesn't get out of hand.
 * 
 * I need a deal function 
 *   I need all the cards to be randomlly dealt
 *   So I need probe if that card has been taken or I could just
 *   Randomly assign a probe?   That might work.  Basically I 
 *   Have to make a scramble function.  Hm. 
 *   This will the hardest function. 
 *   Randomly assigning the ranks. 
 * I need a round function
 *   This will have a end game test to see if it is time to end the game yet. 
 *   I don't quite know how I'm going to do the end game.
 *   I have to make an iA(ish) for each player.  I would be fun to make
 *   them sufitacated but not a thing I can do quite yet. 
 *   Player one:  Plays the lowest card it can. 
 *   					Works for playing too. 
 *   Player two:  Plays randomly a card that works. 
 *   				Works for playing too
 *   Player three:Plays the highest(That is too easy) when playing 
 *                and lowest when starting. 
 * Rank Function 
 * 	This will just rank them, easy enough.
